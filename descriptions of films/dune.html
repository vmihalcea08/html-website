        <h1>Dune (2021)</h1>
        <h3>Dune is a science fiction film directed by Denis Villeneuve, based on the 1965 novel by Frank Herbert. It follows Paul Atreides, a young noble, as he travels to the desert planet Arrakis, where he must face political intrigue, betrayal, and destiny.</h3>
        <h3>Arrakis is both precious and dangerous — its vast deserts are inhabited by the native Fremen people and enormous, deadly sandworms. When House Atreides becomes the target of a deadly betrayal by their rivals, the Harkonnens, Paul is thrust into a journey of survival, self-discovery, and prophecy, as he begins to fulfill a destiny greater than he ever imagined.</h3>
        <h3>The film explores themes of power, colonialism, destiny, and ecology, blending intense visuals with deep philosophical questions.</h3>
